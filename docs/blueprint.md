## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: A light blue (#E1F5FE), to ensure the bright primary color pops, yet not stark white to keep a modern appearance.
- Accent color: An analogous blue-green (#29E2BB) to give interactive elements some vibrance without clashing.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective, and neutral look, ideal for a professional resume builder.
- Use clean, professional icons from a consistent set to represent different sections and actions within the app.
- Employ a grid-based layout to present resume templates and user input forms in an organized manner.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience during form interactions and resume preview updates.
